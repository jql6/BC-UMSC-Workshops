### WORKSHOP DETAILS:
Maple is a general purpose mathematics system with a large library of tools for computations in many areas of mathematics. It is a programming language like Matlab, but has facilities for exact computation; it will produce formulas for integrals, factor polynomials over finite fields, and solve systems of polynomials with an infinite number of solutions.

In the workshop I will introduce basic tools for doing calculus in one and two variables, generating 2D and 3D plots of curves and surfaces, demo the graph theory package for fun, and then we'll do some experiments with calculating integrals and visualizing eigenvectors.

### WORKSHOP ASSUMPTIONS: 
No prior knowledge of Maple is assumed.
