### WORKSHOP DETAILS:

R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides an open source route to easily apply a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

In this workshop participants will take their first steps with R. The objective of this workshop will focus on creating new variables to conduct basic calculations, getting data to R, conducting simple statistics and visualization with R, and then introducing linear regression and decision tree models with applications in R.

### WORKSHOP ASSUMPTIONS:
No prior experience with R is required.
